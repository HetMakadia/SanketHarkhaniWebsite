        name: "Hands-Free Scanning Optimization",
        description: "Developed a hands-free scanning system using wearable ring scanners integrated with existing Honeywell hardware. Identified motion waste and downtime caused by traditional pistol-grip scanners, then implemented a solution improving ergonomic efficiency and reducing cycle time by 2–3 seconds per container. Delivered pilot testing, associate feedback analysis, and performance evaluation for broader deployment.",

        name: "High-Efficiency Production Workflow Redesign, Smith Induspac",
        description: "Identified inefficiencies in the cut-glue-cut workflow and introduced a reverse process—gluing large formats first, then slitting—to reduce handling, waste, and cycle time. This approach improved gluing speed, minimized cardboard waste, and cut overall production time by nearly 50%. The solution was standardized for select box types, increasing consistency and line efficiency.",

        name: "Process Standardization & Visual SOP Implementation, Smith Induspac",
        description: "Implemented a QR-code-based Visual SOP system that replaced confusing 2D packaging specs, resulting in a 40%+ reduction in quality errors and faster task execution. The solution enabled real-time access to visual work instructions, streamlining training and boosting consistency across shifts. This Lean-driven initiative improved process clarity, minimized rework, and strengthened operational efficiency on the production floor.",
